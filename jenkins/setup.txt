Can either install jenkins on my machine or run it as a docker image...

Going to run it as a docker image
https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins

    - docker pull jenkins:{version}

run jenkins docker 

    - docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v ~/jenkins/:/var/jenkins_home jenkins:2.60.3

access local host 8080

    need administrator password to acess jenkins web

        - docker logs containerId

click on install suggested plugins

    ran into error 

        "An error occurred during installation: No such plugin: cloudbees-folder"

        may have something to do with volumes

        http://localhost:8080/restart

        allows you to access jenkins (has no plugins)

    use the version which is updated

    https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/tags

    docker pull jenkins/jenkins:latest <-- dont even have to pull, can just run the command below and itll do both

    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure -v ~/jenkins/:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11

Creating a project and connecting to github


    create multibranch pipeline

        add git clone link

            https://github.com/aaAbdulkadir/DevOps.git

        add credentials

            github username and password

        run

    add webhook for github to jenkins

        on jenkins:

            configure system

            override hook url

                http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/

        on github:

            go to add webhook. the url link cannot be local host, must be public domain

            deploy on cloud.



    rather than multibranch, you can use pipeline

        just need to fill in the pipeline section, 

            pipeline script from scm

            git

            git clone link

            change branch to main as master is old

            change jenkins filepath

        run

            set up github webhook using personal access token
