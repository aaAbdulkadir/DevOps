Can either install jenkins on my machine or run it as a docker image...

Going to run it as a docker image
https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins

    - docker pull jenkins:{version}

run jenkins docker 

    - docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v ~/jenkins/:/var/jenkins_home jenkins:2.60.3

access local host 8080

    need administrator password to acess jenkins web

        - docker logs containerId

click on install suggested plugins

    ran into error 

        "An error occurred during installation: No such plugin: cloudbees-folder"

        may have something to do with volumes

        http://localhost:8080/restart

        allows you to access jenkins (has no plugins)

    use the version which is updated

    https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/tags

    docker pull jenkins/jenkins:latest <-- dont even have to pull, can just run the command below and itll do both

    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11

Creating a project and connecting to github

    - create multibranch pipeline

        -- branch source: project to build. select git

        -- paste link of repo 

        -- get credentials

            go to manage credentials in jenkins

                click on system global and add credential

                    set a global scope

                    use kind: username with password

                        set username and password to global and id 

                create a system credential

                    name username, id and password: system

                go to dashboard created and click on the newly craeted project,
                inside it click on credentials

                    this scope is limited to the project

                    inside this domain, add credential

                        call username, password, id: my-pipeline

                    then, it was deleted... 

                    deleted to create a uername and password for the git repo (not just a dummy)


        -- back on the config page, 

            add the git repo credentials

            save

    -- create jenkins file and push to github repo
